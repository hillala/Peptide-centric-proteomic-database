# Peptide-centric-proteomic-database
This tool transform  protein sequences database  to a database structure is batter suit to identify particular isoforms. 
This tool transform  protein sequences database file generated from UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot. In the new database isolates isoform-specific sequences is organized  in separate entries, and eliminates redundancies between isoforms that share sequences. The novel database structure is batter suit to identify particular isoforms.
